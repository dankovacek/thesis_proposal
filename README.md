# Thesis Proposal

This repository is the organizational structure for a thesis proposal.

To update the book, from the root folder `thesis_proposal/`:

>`jupyter book build chapters/`

When the repository is rendered to a github site (assuming site setup is done):

>`ghp-import -n -p -f chapters/_build/html/`
